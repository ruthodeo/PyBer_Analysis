      1.The main recomendations will be to increase the numbers of drivers in rural cities in order to fix the average fare per ride and per rider, more drivers, more rides. 
      
      2.A reductions of the ride fare for "rural" cities will make a big positive diference for the benefict of the company. 
      
      3.A decrease of drivers in "Urban" cities will help to have better analysis and a plus will be to include the distance each driver drive , those fares are based by the             mile? or per time? definetly need more information.
